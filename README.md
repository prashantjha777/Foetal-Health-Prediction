# Foetal-Health-Prediction
This project aims to predict foetal health using machine learning algorithms applied to Cardiotocography (CTG) data. The system classifies the foetal health into three categories: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological. The goal is to assist medical professionals in making more accurate decisions, thereby improving outcomes and reducing potential risks.
